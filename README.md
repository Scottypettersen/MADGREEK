Mad Greek Racing represents the heart and soul of grassroots endurance racing, featuring our pride and joy - a meticulously built BMW E46 wagon powered by a freshly swapped S54 engine. Our website serves as the digital pit garage where fans and fellow racing enthusiasts can experience the thrill of budget endurance racing through our comprehensive photo gallery documenting every race, repair, and victory. Visitors can support our racing endeavors by browsing our merchandise store, featuring team apparel and accessories that celebrate our unique blend of Greek heritage and motorsport passion. The 'About' section tells our story, from the initial vision of transforming a humble E46 wagon into a competitive endurance racer, to our current achievements on the track. Whether you're a die-hard BMW enthusiast, an aspiring racer, or simply someone who appreciates the dedication it takes to build and race on a budget, Mad Greek Racing welcomes you to join our journey.
